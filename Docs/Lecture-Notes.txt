Converts machine understandable code to Operating System (OS) understandable format. .obj ⇒ .exe
Linker adds a primary header to the object code file. 
Primary Header:
Magic number. For Windows magic number ⇒ MZ it is short form by its inventor’s name - Mark Zbkawskbi
Entry for entry-point function e.g. main()
.
.

L005 : 29 April 2023

Native development: (Where performance, fastest response in minimum amount of time is of utmost importance)
 - OS dev
 - System programming
 - Graphics 
 - Game 
 - Audio Video
 - Digital Signal processing
 - Image Processing
 - Embedded systems, RTOS, mission critical

 VM Based development (Where performance, fast response are not mandatory):
 - Internet browsing
 - Scripting

Six Technologies we are going to learn:
1. Windows - OpenGL + DirectX
2. Linux - OpenGL
3. Android - OpenGL ES
4. Web - OpenGL ES
5. macOS - OpenGL
6. iOS - OpenGL ES

Software Development:
Every OS comes with SDK to facilitate software/tool development. Its known as native SDK.

SDKs for OpenGL based software development:
Windows: 
H/W -> Windows OS -> Native SDK (Win32 SDK) : We are going to learn OpenGL development using Win32 SDK
H/W -> Windows OS -> Native SDK (Win32 SDK) -> Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC)
H/W -> Windows OS -> Native SDK (Win32 SDK) -> Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) -> .Net
H/W -> Windows OS -> Native SDK (Win32 SDK) -> Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) -> .Net -> 
	Scripting (1. Web - WebGL 2. Python - PyGL)

Linux:
H/W -> Linux OS -> XLib SDK : We are going to learn OpenGL development using XLib SDK
H/W -> Linux OS -> XLib SDK -> GDK/GTK/Qt
H/W -> Linux OS -> XLib SDK -> GDK/GTK/Qt -> Java
H/W -> Linux OS -> XLib SDK -> GDK/GTK/Qt -> Java -> Scripting (1. Web - WebGL 2. Python - PyGL)

	Framework: Frameworks are made for faster development
	Examples - 
	Qt, freeglut, MFC, .Net

Android:
H/W -> Linux OS -> Androdized Linux (Android)
H/W -> Linux OS -> Android -> NDK (Native development Kit using C/C++)
H/W -> Linux OS -> Android -> NDK -> Android SDK(Its a native framework, development using Java)

JVM runs Java program. Java as a language is not slow. 
The program written in Java runs on JVM and JVM is virtual hence it is slow. 
But in Android, Java program runs on Dalvik which is faster than JVM.
Dalvik is similar to LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine), whereas JVM is similar to HLVM (High Level Virtual Machine).
Hence Java programs/Games in Android are not slow.

Android NDK examples:
1. Vulcan
2. OpenCL (Open Computing Language)
3. CUDA 
4. Android based DirectX wrapper
5. Compute shedder from OpenGL

macOS:
H/W -> macOS -> Cocoa SDK (Swift, Objective-C)
H/W -> macOS -> Cocoa SDK -> Swift UI, COCOS SDK etc -> Java

iOS:
H/W -> iOS -> Coco touch SDK (Objective-C)

WebGL:
H/W -> OS -> COM -> WinJs(Windows JavaScript) -> Browser -> Javascript (WebGL programming based on OpenGL-ES)



QA:
Q1. How to create Games?
Learn rendering technology - OpenGL, DirectX, Vulcan, Metal
	A] Directly create game using C, C++, Objective-C, Java etc
	B] Game Engine (Examples - Unreal, Unity, Cry, Unigine, XNA etc) and 
		or Design Softwares (Examples - MAYA, 3dsMax, Udiny, Nuke, zBrush, Auto-CAD)
		1. Using UI (Drag and Drop)
		2. Scripting Languages
			1. Engine Specific Scripting Languages; Example - MEL (Maya Embedding Language), MaxScript
			2. Common Programming Language, example - C++(Unreal, Unigine, Crytech), C#(Unity, XNA), Python
				Here C++ is not compiled, it is used as scripting language.

C# is touch faster than Java because Java is interpreted and C# is compiled language.
=============================================================================================================================
L006 : 30 April 2023

How Virtual Machine Development works:
1. Source code -> Compile(From Human understandable to VM understandable format) -> VM (JVM/CLR) -> 
Compile (From VM understandable to Real Machine understandable format) -> CPU

2. Source code (Scripting languages MEL, Maxscript, C++, C#, Python etc) -> VM -> Compile(JIT) -> CPU

Compiler (Code to VM): It is a static compiler

Compiler (VM to CPU): It is a runtime compiler also known as JIT (Just In Time) compiler.
	This is applicable to Java, C# and all the scripting languages.

Trivia:
Which scripting language is a compiled and does not need VM to run? It is not interprted.
XAML (eXtended Application Markup Language)


OpenGL and Direct3D are realtime rendering technology.
			
	|	  | Metal (Apple) - 2014	|
	|	  | Vulkan - 2016			| OpenGL
H/W | OS  |							|
	|	  | Direct3D 12 - 2015		| Direct3D 11
	|	  | Ray Tracing - 2018		|

Ray tracing in
- Metal : MPS (Metal Performance Shedder)
- VKRay : Vulkan Ray Tracing
- DXR	: DirectX Ray Tracing

Why Ray Tracing came into existence?
- Because of PBRT (Physically Based Rendering Technology)

AR - Augmented Reality
VR - Virtual Reality
MR - Mixed Reality = AR + VR

For Maximum reality Ray Tracing is introduced and 
for maximum performance mutithreading was introduced in to - Metal, Vulkan etc

# Graphic Card -> Deice Driver(Part of OS) -> OpenGL / Direct3D 11
For maximum performance and reality (AR, VR, MR), graphic card driver was cut in to different part
1. Lowest level driver 2. Higher level driver (Technologies - Metal, Vulkan, Direct3D 12)

# Graphic Card -> Deice Driver(Lowest level) -> Metal/Vulkan/Direct3D 12 -> OpenGL/Direct3D 11

# Graphic Card -> Deice Driver(Lowest level) -> Ray Tracing | Metal/Vulkan/Direct3D 12 -> OpenGL/Direct3D 11

=============================================================================================================================
L010 : 12 May 2023	(C - Pradnya )

Assignment 1 - Hello World

Variables and Constants:

Syntax:

(1) <data types> <identifier name> 

(2) <data types> <identifier name> = <value> ;

Identifier name:
	- should conntain alphabets
	- name can not start with a number
	- name can start with '_'
	- space is not allowed in identifier name
	- identifier name can be maximum 32 character


int num = 5;
int num1 = 10, num2 = 20, num3 = 30;
printf("Num is = %d", num);

sizeof() gives how many bytes are given to a value of a data type.

float data type - Single precision floating point value
float f;	// declaration
float f1 = 3.14f; // declaration + initialization(inline initialization)
printf("f is = %f",f1);

double d; // double precision floating pointer values
d = 1.145444;
double d1 = 3.1415965
printf("d is = %lf", d1);
printf("d is = %g"", d);

unsigned int uNum = 33"
printf("uiNum is = %u", uNum);

long L = 313133L;
printf("L = %ldl");

unsigned long => %u

long double ld = 1.343434;

char c;
c = 'A';
char ch = 'P';
printf("ch is = %c", ch );

float f = 4312.2161712;
%4.4f = 4312.2162

String formatting:
Escape sequence:
\n = new line
\t = tab (spaces)
\b = backspace
\r = Carriage return
\ooo = print octal value
\xhh = print hrxadecimal

Escape sequence will be used in shedders.

printf("My name is \"Batman\"\n"); => My name is "Batman"

=============================================================================================================================
L011 : 13 May 2023	(C - Pradnya )

Constants:
1. const
2. enum
3. #define
4. Directly used constant (example x = 2; here 2 is constant)

1. const
syntax
const <data type> <identifier name> = <value>;

const is a type qualifier

2. #define
#define <IDENTIFIER NAME> <value>
These are called symbolic constants

3. enum
Vertex attribute will use enum.

4. Directly used constants
When we use	a value directly in C program without creating a variable, it is known as a Literal.
And these literals are a fixed value hence known as Literal constants.

Operators:
1. Arithmetic (Unary and Binary)
2. Relational (Binary)
3. Logical (Unary and Binary)
4. Bitwise (Unary and Binary)

1. Arithmetic operators:
- Basic (Binary):
+, -, *, /, %, =
Associativity:
+ left to right
- left to right
* left to right
/ left to right
% left to right
= right to left

c = a + b;
It read as "a plus b is assigned to c".

* and - are unary and binary based on number of operands.
b = -c;
b = *p;

% works on integer operands only

- Compound assignment (Binary):
+=, -=, *=, /=, %=

Associativity
+= right to left 
-= right to left 
*= right to left 
/= right to left 
%= right to left 

Precedence: BODMAS
2 * 3 + 4 = 10
2 * (3 + 4) = 14
Refer Dennis Ritchie C programming book for precedence table.


- Increment / decrement (Unary):
++, --
postfix :
a++, c--

prefix:
++a, --c
associativity : 

2. Relational (Binary)
<, >, <=, >=, !=, ==

associativity : left to right

3. Logical (Unary and Binary)
- Binary Logical operators
&& (Logical AND), || (Logical OR) : Left to Right

- Unary Logical Operator
! (logical Not) : Right to Left
